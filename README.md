This repository was created to share additional material for the short paper "Visual Interface Design for Informal Language Acquisition with Machine Translation and LLMs" submitted for the AVI 2026 conference. 

It contains: 

- Images: The ILA Framework and its Interaction Method; a screenshot of the ILA interface; a table for the heuristic evaluation results.
- PDFs: the prompt used for the AI-based heuristic evaluation; the user persona cards used by human and AI evaluators in the heuristic evaluation.
- Excel: the survey answers and results that informed the personas and requirements definition.
